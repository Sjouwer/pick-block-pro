# **Pick Block Pro**

Pick Block: Get the block/item of what you're looking at in creative or switch to that block/item in survival.  
This mod is an advanced version of this and adds a lot of extra features (see below)

**Important:**  
This mod replaces the default Pick Block, however the ID and Tool picker use their own keybindings.  

## **Features**
Most things below are configurable in the config settings using the config file or Mod Menu
- Extended Pick Block range, decide how far the picker should be able to reach
- Pick block extra things:  
  - Pick fluids and get a bucket of the fluid  
  - Pick fire and get a flint & steel  
  - Pick the sun or moon and get a light block  
    Cycle through the light levels by picking the sun or moon while holding the light block  
  - Pick block spawners
- Lock inventory slots to prevent the picker from switching or replacing the item in that slot
- Hold ALT while picking and add BlockState data to the block/item (stacks with CTRL for BlockEntity data)
- Copy ID's of hotbar slot blocks/items directly into your chat, for easy WorldEdit command creation  
(Use CTRL + 0 through 9 while your chat is open, 0 is for the off hand slot)
- Pick ID's of blocks in the world with the ID Picker and copy them directly to your clipboard
- Use the Tool Picker and get the best available tool to break the block or kill the entity
- Creative inventory management (not just the hotbar) is now actually possible when picking blocks
